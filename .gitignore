#The rules for the patterns you can put in the .gitignore file are as follows:
#Blank lines or lines starting with # are ignored.
#Standard glob patterns work.
#You can start patterns with a forward slash (/) to avoid recursivity.
#You can end patterns with a forward slash (/) to specify a directory.
#You can negate a pattern by starting it with an exclamation point (!).
#Glob patterns are like simplified regular expressions that shells use. An asterisk (*) matches zero or more characters; [abc] matches any character inside the brackets (in this case a, b, or c); a question mark (?) matches a single character; and brackets enclosing characters separated by a hyphen ([0-9]) matches any character between them (in this case 0 through 9). You can also use two asterisks to match nested directories; a/**/z would match a/z, a/b/z, a/b/c/z, and so on.
#Here is another example .gitignore file:
# no .a files
#*.a
# but do track lib.a, even though you're ignoring .a files above
#!lib.a
# only ignore the TODO file in the current directory, not subdir/TODO
#/TODO
# ignore all files in the build/ directory
#build/
# ignore doc/notes.txt, but not doc/server/arch.txt
#doc/*.txt
# ignore all .pdf files in the doc/ directory and any of its subdirectories
#doc/**/*.pdf
